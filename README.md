## About the Project

Emote stop is a tool to resize images for Twitch Emotes/Badges, Discord Emotes/Stickers and for any other social media application. It's a frontend only tool, utilizing NextJs and ShadcnUI.

I created this since manually resizing the emotes gets cumbersome really quick, especially if you have to do a bunch of them together.
